NetMiddlewares is an organization to work on the creation of a set of useful .NET Core middlewares packages as well as the creation of resources about custom middlewares implementations.

We believe that middlewares are a great solution for a lot of problems Web APIs face and open source solutions should exist to tackle them.

### Middlewares available
- [NetMiddlewares.Guid](https://github.com/netmiddlewares/NetMiddlewares.Guid) - .NET Core middleware to generate a Guid and add it to a request and response header.


### Projects using NetMiddlewares
If you have an open source project that uses any of the middlewares, feel free to share here!
- [MiddlewareSandbox](https://github.com/renanliberato/MiddlewaresSandbox) - .NET Core WebAPI to exemplify useful middlewares
